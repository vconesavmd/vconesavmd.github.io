            San Francisco: the best and the worst
        </h1>
        <h2>
            The best neighborhood is Sunset
        </h2>
        <p>
            Is a super underrated neighborhood. It's <strong>affordable</strong> by <em>San Francisco standards</em>, <strong>family friendly</strong> and full of interesing places and restaurants.
        </p>
        <h2>
            The worst neighborhood is The Financial District
        </h2>
        <p>
            Where the homeless community meets <em>Hipsterland</em>. Walking on it is basically a game of dodging poops and bearded men of any socio-economic level.
